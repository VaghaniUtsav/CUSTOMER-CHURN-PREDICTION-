## 📖 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical business challenge that helps companies identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services. This project implements a comprehensive machine learning solution to predict customer churn with high accuracy, enabling businesses to take proactive measures for customer retention.

### 🔍 What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn occurs when customers stop using a company's products or services. Predicting churn allows businesses to:
- **Reduce revenue loss** by identifying at-risk customers
- **Improve customer satisfaction** through targeted interventions
- **Optimize marketing strategies** for better retention
- **Enhance customer lifetime value**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Analyze customer behavior patterns and identify churn indicators
- ✅ Build and compare multiple machine learning models for churn prediction
- ✅ Achieve high prediction accuracy with optimal precision and recall
- ✅ Provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies
- ✅ Create an end-to-end ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer information including:
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, gender, location
- **Service Usage**: Monthly charges, total charges, tenure
- **Service Details**: Contract type, payment method, services subscribed
- **Target Variable**: Churn (Yes/No)

### 📈 Dataset Statistics
- **Total Records**: [Number of records]
- **Features**: [Number of features]
- **Churn Rate**: [Percentage]%
- **Data Quality**: [Percentage]% complete data
